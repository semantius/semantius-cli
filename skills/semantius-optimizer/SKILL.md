description: >-
  Reverse-engineers a `*-semantic-spec.md` file (the analyst artifact, version
  "5.4") from a live Semantius module: reads the module's entities, fields,
  enum values, permissions, roles, and permission hierarchy via `semantius`,
  pulls in referenced built-ins (e.g. `users`) so the output is
  self-contained, and writes a spec byte-compatible with the template
  `semantius-analyst` produces and `semantius-modeler` deploys. Deterministic:
  the mapping runs through `references/spec-extract-lib.ts`. After saving,
  optionally runs an audit pass. Trigger when the user wants to extract /
  export / optimize / snapshot / reverse-engineer / pull / regenerate a spec
  from a live Semantius module, build a spec for a module created without one,
  or bring a customized live module back in sync with a markdown spec. Example
  phrases: "generate a spec from the `{slug}` module", "reverse-engineer the
  `{slug}` module into a spec", "someone built a module in the UI, get me a
  spec", "pull `{slug}` down to a semantic spec".

# semantius-optimizer Skill

Closes the reverse arc of the spec lifecycle. It is the fifth peer of the
`semantius-*` family (architect / analyst / modeler / use-semantius): the only one
that runs the pipeline **backwards**, from live catalog to `*-semantic-spec.md`.

```
semantius-architect → semantius-analyst → semantius-modeler → (users customize / build in the UI) → semantius-optimizer → …
```

The `*-semantic-spec.md` this skill produces is **interchangeable with one the
`semantius-analyst` skill writes**: same front-matter keys, same section structure
(§1 Overview … §9 Governance), same reconciliation annotations. The
`semantius-modeler` can re-deploy it; the analyst can audit or extend it. That
compatibility is the point: without it, a module built directly in the Semantius
UI (or customized live) has no spec, and nothing in the pipeline can govern it.

**Primary use case:** a module exists in production with no spec (built in the UI,
or drifted from its original). This skill produces the missing `*-semantic-spec.md`
from live state, which then feeds `semantius-analyst` Extend/Audit or a
`semantius-modeler` re-deploy.

## Division of responsibility

- **This skill** owns the workflow: pick the module, run the deterministic
  extractor, present the result, and audit it only if the user later asks.
- **`references/spec-extract-lib.ts`** owns the mapping: it is the single
  deterministic source of the generated markdown. All live→spec rules live there,
  not in prose, so the output is reproducible and every rule is one place.
- **`use-semantius`** owns the platform contract (the `semantius` CLI, PostgREST
  encoding, the built-ins list).
- **This skill is READ-ONLY against Semantius.** It never writes to the platform.
  Any fix is applied to the `.md` only; a re-deploy via `semantius-modeler` is how
  changes reach the live catalog.

## Writing conventions (every output this skill produces)

1. **US English spellings, always** (optimize not `optimise`, behavior not
   `behaviour`, modeling not `modelling`, canceled not `cancelled`). Prefer the
   `-ize` / `-or` / `-er` form.
2. **No em-dashes (`—`).** Use `(...)`, a comma, or split sentences. En-dash and
   hyphen in ranges/compounds are fine.
3. **Singular-subject grammar in prompts** ("Looks good?" not "Look good?").

---

## Schema compatibility

This skill writes files at `version: "5.4"` (the analyst's `CURRENT_VERSION`; the
`SPEC_VERSION` constant in `spec-extract-lib.ts`). The `semantius-modeler` carries
an `EXPECTED_MAJOR` and rejects a mismatched major, so the constant must track the
analyst. A major analyst bump (section renumber, table-shape change, new required
key) forces a coordinated update of the analyst template, this skill's extractor,
and the modeler.

The authoritative output shape is
`semantius-plugin/skills/semantius-analyst/references/semantic-spec-template.md`.
Read it before changing the extractor.

---

## Step 0: Load required context

Read first:

- `<skills-root>/use-semantius/SKILL.md` and
  `<skills-root>/use-semantius/references/data-modeling.md` (built-ins list,
  platform constraints).
- `<skills-root>/semantius-analyst/references/semantic-spec-template.md` (the
  output template the extractor targets).
- `references/spec-extract-lib.ts` in this skill folder (the mapping).

## High-level workflow

```
1. Pick module  →  2. Pre-flight the output path, then run the extractor  →  3. Present + verify  →  (4. Audit, only if the user later asks)
```

### Communicating during the run — work quietly; the report is the deliverable

This is deterministic, mostly mechanical work. On the happy path the user should see
**only three things**: (1) the module-picker table, *if* the module is ambiguous or
was not named; (2) the overwrite question, *if* the output file already exists; (3)
the final report (Stage 3). Nothing else.

Do NOT narrate the steps or explain internal mechanics between tool calls. The
tool-call chips already show progress, so prose like the lines below — every one of
them taken from a real run — is pure noise. Never write anything of this kind:

- "The skill is symlinked to `semantius-plugin/skills/semantius-optimizer`."
- "The canonical output path does not exist yet, so it's free to write."
- "`bun 1.3.12` is available."
- "Running the extractor now (no `--force` needed since the file doesn't exist)."
- "The manual filter didn't apply, but the extractor uses the correct shape internally."

The stage names in this workflow are internal structure — never announce "Stage 1",
"Stage 2a", etc. Load the required context, pre-flight the output path, and run the
extractor **silently**. If the module was named and unambiguous, hand its slug
straight to the extractor — it fails fast with a clear error on an unknown slug, so a
separate confirmation read is optional; don't perform one just to have something to
report. The next words the user reads after their request should be the Stage 3
report itself.

## Stage 1: Pick the module

If the user named a module, use its slug directly. Otherwise list candidates:

```bash
semantius call crud read_module '{"order": "module_name.asc"}'
```

Present `module_name`, `module_slug`, `module_type`, `access_scope` as a compact
table and ask which to extract. Never guess when several match. Never create a
module here (read-only).

## Stage 2: Run the extractor

### Stage 2a: Pre-flight, never overwrite silently

BEFORE doing any work, check whether the output file already exists:

```bash
test -f semantius/specs/<module_slug>-semantic-spec.md && echo EXISTS || echo FREE
```

(PowerShell: `Test-Path semantius/specs/<module_slug>-semantic-spec.md`.)

- **FREE (does not exist):** go to Stage 2b and write it.
- **EXISTS:** STOP and ask the user which they want, then wait for the answer:
  1. **Replace** the existing file.
  2. **Save under a different name** (the user supplies one, or you suggest an
     unused path such as `<slug>-semantic-spec-2.md`).
  3. **Stop** and change nothing.

  Do not guess and do not proceed until the user picks. This check is up front on
  purpose: the extractor must never do a run's worth of reads and then clobber a
  file, and it must never replace an existing file without an explicit yes.

### Stage 2b: Run

```bash
bun run references/spec-extract-lib.ts <module_slug> <chosen_outfile>
```

Pass the path the user chose. Add `--force` ONLY when the user chose **Replace**;
without `--force` the script refuses to overwrite. The script applies the same guard
itself, and it checks the output path first, before any live read, so a direct
invocation also fails fast instead of doing work and then clobbering.

The script reads module, entities (creation order), fields (field-order, auto-
fields stripped), permissions, roles, and permission hierarchy; discovers
referenced built-ins; and writes the spec. It prints a one-line summary
(entity / permission counts). It is idempotent and side-effect-free against the
platform.

If `bun` is unavailable, `node` also runs it (the script uses only `Bun.spawn` /
`Bun.write`; on plain Node, invoke via `bunx` or install bun; do not hand-port the
mapping into prose, that reintroduces the non-determinism this design removes).

## Stage 3: Present and verify

The deliverable is a SHORT, human-facing report — roughly 6-10 lines. The reader
asked for a spec; answer the three questions they actually have, in order:

1. **Did it work, and where's the file?** One line, with the path as a clickable link.
2. **How far can I trust it?** One sentence: the spec mirrors the live module, so
   everything the platform stores (entities, fields, relationships, enums,
   permissions, roles) is faithful.
3. **What must I fix by hand?** A short list — usually 2-4 items — of things the live
   module doesn't store, so they couldn't be recovered. Phrase each as a plain to-do
   about the spec.

Close with one line pointing anyone who wants the missing content authored properly
at `semantius-analyst` Extend mode.

**Write it for the reader, not the pipeline.** Do NOT put any of this in the report:
stage numbers, the labels "Category A/B", "byte-compatible", "reverse pass",
"canonical order", "reconciliation annotations", "the modeler can re-deploy / the
analyst can audit", a dumped list of frontmatter keys, or a "trust these" enumeration
of every faithfully-copied section. That vocabulary is internal; reciting it is the
noise this section exists to prevent. If the report runs long, it is narrating
machinery — cut it.

### Worked example of a good report (it-ops-starter)

> **Done — wrote [`it-ops-starter-semantic-spec.md`](semantius/specs/it-ops-starter-semantic-spec.md).**
>
> It mirrors the live module, so the entities, fields, relationships, enums,
> permissions, and roles come straight from what's deployed — trust those.
>
> Three things to fix by hand (the live module doesn't store them, so I couldn't
> recover them):
> - **Overview** is just a placeholder — the module's one-line tagline. Rewrite it
>   into a couple of real sentences.
> - **Field descriptions** are mostly blank; only a few fields carry one.
> - **Some record labels** (e.g. "Contract Number") were guessed from the column
>   name — skim them to make sure they read right.
>
> Want the missing prose authored properly? Run `semantius-analyst` in Extend mode
> on this file.

Adapt the bullets to what actually applies to the module (drop any that don't; the
Overview one almost always applies). Mention lost provenance metadata (license,
source blueprint, related modules, the original request, personas) only if it matters
to this reader, and in one line — never a key-by-key list.

### Internal reference: faithful vs best-effort (use it to choose what to flag; never recite it)

**Category A — faithful from live (trust; nothing to flag):** all platform
frontmatter; §2 table & labels; the Mermaid edge set; every §3 entity annotation
(plural label, label column, audit log, edit permission, entity type, label parent,
reconciliation); every §3 field's name / format / required / Notes; §3 Relationships
prose; §4 rows; §5 enumerations; §8.1 permissions; §8.2 and §9 governance; §9.1
hierarchy. Entity order is the canonical `entity_type` tier then `table_name` A->Z, so
it round-trips against a convention-compliant spec.

**Category B — best-effort or omitted (this is your fix-by-hand source):**
1. Authored frontmatter keys — `description` block, `blueprint_version`, `license`,
   `created_at`, `reconciled_*`, `source_blueprint`, `related_modules`,
   `related_domains`, `departments`, `initial_request`, `persona`. Omitted (not
   persisted).
2. §1 Overview — seeded from the tagline.
3. §2 Purpose column — first sentence of each entity description.
4. §3 label-column titles — humanized field name (`contract_title` → "Contract
   Title"); irregulars like `app_name` → "Application Name" are not recoverable.
5. §3 field Description — live truth, often empty.
6. Built-in entity description (e.g. `users`) — live value, not authored prose.
7. §6 / §7.1 / §7.2 — emitted `_(none)_`.
8. A junction M:N's hand-authored business verb — the structure round-trips (canonical
   "`X` ↔ `Y` is many-to-many through the `<junction>` junction table"), the verb does not.

**Drift check (only when comparing against an authored source spec).** If a value the
platform *does* persist differs from the source spec, that is a forward-pipeline
(`semantius-modeler` / `semantius-architect`) bug, not a limitation here — surface it
separately and plainly. Observed on `it-ops-starter`: the modeler dropping the
label-field title and some `field.description` values; a malformed hyphen/underscore
role slug from the architect. A plain generate run has no source to diff, so this note
does not apply to it.

## Stage 4: Audit the extracted spec for live-model defects (only when the user asks)

**Why the analyst is the right auditor.** `semantius-analyst` OWNS the spec artifact:
it authors specs (blueprint → spec) and its Mode B Audit is the canonical read-only
checker for a `*-semantic-spec.md`. Because this skill just wrote a spec, the analyst
audit is available — but on a *reverse-engineered* spec its value is specific: the
spec mirrors live state, so any real modeling defect the audit finds is a genuine
problem **in the live module**, now made visible. That is the point of running it.

**Do not prompt for this. The skill ends at Stage 3.** Never ask, offer, or pop up a
question about the audit (no `AskUserQuestion`, no trailing "want me to audit?" line).
Delivering the spec plus its Stage 3 verification is the end of a normal run. A
freshly generated spec does not need an unprompted audit, and the trailing question
reads as noise.

Run the audit ONLY when the user explicitly asks for it in a later turn (e.g. "audit
it", "check the live model for defects"). When they do, run the `semantius-analyst`
Mode B checks against the written file, and split the findings:

- **Real live-model defects (surface as actionable):** label-column-is-a-FK, missing
  or filler `relationship_label`, malformed JsonLogic, duplicate `validation_rules`
  codes, an enum whose live values would orphan records. These describe the live
  module; fixing them means a `semantius-modeler` re-deploy.
- **Authoring-completeness findings (expected — do NOT surface as actionable):**
  missing `initial_request`, empty §6/§7, missing `description` block. These fire *by
  construction* on every extracted spec (they are the Category-B authored content live
  never held). Note them as expected, not as problems.

Do NOT confuse this authoring audit with an extraction-fidelity check. "Does the spec
faithfully match live?" is a different question, answered by re-running the extractor
(deterministic) or a `semantius-modeler` deploy-test round-trip — not by the analyst.

## Verifying the extractor (for maintainers)

A reference module (`it-ops-starter`) and its hand-authored master spec
(`semantius/specs/master-it-ops-starter-semantic-spec.md`) anchor a round-trip
check: regenerate `it-ops-starter-semantic-spec.md` from live and confirm every
diff against the master falls in Category B. The master predates the canonical
entity-order convention, so its entity/section sequence differs from the extractor's
canonical order (compare Mermaid/§2/§3/§4/§5 order as sets, not line-by-line); a
value diff outside Category B is an extractor defect. Re-run this after any change to
`spec-extract-lib.ts` or a bump of the analyst template.

## What this skill does not do

- Does **not** write to Semantius (read-only reverse-engineering).
- Does **not** capture user assignments, sample business data, or webhook logs.
- Does **not** invent authored content (§1 beyond a seed, §6/§7, authored
  frontmatter). Those are the analyst's job in Extend mode.
